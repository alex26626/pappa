Label the Swedish text according to how it describes the role of the father in the family.
Possible labels are: 
-passive: this is a category that captures what is sometimes called the classical role given toand taken by fathers, which in essence is a role that does not include engaging with the child in person. Word used in theory might be “custodial parenthood”, “provider”, “breadwinner”, “process parenthood”. This is a person who is important in the life of the child, but is not involved in the hands-on caring and upbringing. Society includes norms and sometimes creates clarifying policies around this father, for his sake, as well as for the sake of the child and the mother. Envisioned indicators might be words denoting the father being the moneymaker or provider, or someone who provides genes or sperm or overall protection or security.
-active_negative: this is a category that captures the negative roles of fathers, such as the oppressive father, the harsh and violent father, as well as neglecting father. Society needs to create policies around this father in order to restrict/stop him. Envisioned indicators are notions such as dangerous, punish (not educate or discipline in a non-aggressive way), aggressive, violent, oppressive, not paying child support.We also have three categories that capture the positive roles of fathers. Society needs to create policies around this father in order to encourage him. These categories are:
-active_positive_caring: this category focuses on what is stereotypically seen as the female parental role. Envisioned indicators would be words such as caring, warm, nurture, understanding, empathy, listening, comfort, confirming.
-active_positive_challenging: this category focuses on what is stereotypically seen as the male parental role. Envisioned indicators would be things like strengthening activity, risk-taking, daring, try your limits, sport, outgoing, education (including reading to child, which is one of the recurring activities in the data).
-active_positive_other: there are also other ways of being active as a father, and this category captures that. Most typically, this category indicates that the father is competent and reliable, and should be trusted with the child, but it does not single out why. Envisioned indicators are general references to competence, capability, responsibility, rights of and trust in fathers to handle information, take parental leave, get a parental allowance, be present in the life of the child, be an unspecified role model (“boys/girls need male role models”).
-not_applicable: not applicable.

Text:  man kan samtidigt disku- tera om det är lämpligt att surrogatmodern och den tilltänkta fadern gemensamt blir rättsliga föräldrar till ett barn , och att det förhåll- andet kan bli bestående om surrogatmodern väljer att inte avsäga sig föräldraskapet .
